This is a project I built on my path following TheOdinProject curriculum. Also it was my first React project.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge here is to create a page that lets you fill in the data and generate your CV. Even if at first it sounded quite easy, building it only using React made it quite a challenge at first. The user can place his data, and add experience/education elements. Also, the user should be able to remove or edit those elements.

TLDR: Users should be able to:

-   fill in the data and see it displayed on the CV output
-   edit/remove the elements from the output.

## My process

-   First I tought about the important parts of an CV and what components will my app have
-   Then I started with the basic information component, that lets you fill in the name/phone/email inputs and showed them on the output
-   Started creating the same inputs for education/experience components
-   Used datepicker to easily work with the dates
-   Found out that forms would make my work more easy when I took in consideration the error/empty inputs so I swaped to forms.
-   After all the functionality worked as intended, I created the UI

### What I learned

-   I have a better understanding of the state and props now
-   While building the project, I encountered some errors and managed to deal with them.
-   It was the first react project I hosted using github pages so I had to learn this too.
